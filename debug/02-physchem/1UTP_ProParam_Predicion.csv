Extinction coefficients:
Extinction coefficients are in units of  M-1 cm-1, at 280 nm measured in water.
Ext. coefficient    18045
Abs 0.1% (=1 g/l)   0.820, assuming all pairs of Cys residues form cystines



Ext. coefficient    17420
Abs 0.1% (=1 g/l)   0.792, assuming all Cys residues are reduced

Estimated half-life:
The N-terminal of the sequence considered is S (Ser).
The estimated half-life is: 1.9 hours (mammalian reticulocytes, in vitro).
                            >20 hours (yeast, in vivo).
                            >10 hours (Escherichia coli, in vivo).

Instability index:
The instability index (II) is computed to be 73.97
This classifies the protein as unstable.

Aliphatic index: 65.56
Grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY):-0.503
